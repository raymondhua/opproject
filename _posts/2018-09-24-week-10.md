## David's meeting
Fawaz has finished on his part of the project, and David had showed me on what the models do such has positive or negative words, which seemed interesting.

He had CSV files for me to train the models and import them into my project. He also want's me to complete a live version of the site, which I would need to talk to Femi about.

## What I've done

### Site implantation
I've added all the rest of the NLP models functionality on the site, apart from the TSNE, which is very hard to make. I created a modelsFunction Python file with the same functions that it can return the dictionary and changed the API file to only handle POST and GET requests, this is so that I can reduce messy code duplication. 

Now the API.py file handles GET and POST requests and they call the functions that are in the modelFunctions.py file.

### Live site
David had asked Femi to create the site for me to use, he said to me that he is setting up a production server for Michael and Josh to maintain.

## Reflection
The site is now the near same functionality as Tom's NLP site, all I need to do now is to get the TSNE function working before Showcase. With Fawaz done with the project I can finally insert all the news articles into the database and hopefully I can import these models in my project.

This half of the semester, I was happy with what I was doing for my project, I felt like I was on track for what to show for showcase.

### What the site looks like now
