## David's meeting
David wanted me to do a one minute brief of what my project is about.

## What I've done

### Advanced
I managed to find a way to filter the articles by the section, I used a raw SQL statement that would group the articles by the section and also the author.

I had included the author and the sections in the input field (with the first option being the select all query).

### Posters
I decided to make a poster for my project. I used Adobe Illustrator and designed a few A4 posters on what my site is about and I've included a few screenshots of examples of what the site does.

### Site deployment
After a week of hassling Michael, my site is now running outside of Polytechnic, this was the most struggling issue that needed to be resolved since I had to rely on someone who has these skills and knowledge to get it up and running.

### Minor bug fixing
For the NLP section, if the user selects two of the same years then it would have two separate year columns for both of the same year. I resolved it by checking if the coxtext for year1 and if are the same I set year2 to nothing.

Another bug fix I discovered is that if the user enters no fields but the year is selected, it goes back to the output page with nothing loading. So I add a boolean that sets it to false at the start and if something is filled out, it sets to true and if it is false at the end it redirects them back to the NLP home page with a message saying that they need to fill out something below.

For my OOSD assignment, I used a built-in Django function so whenever if there are any messages, it displays back to the user.

This the code for the error checking function

And this is if the user enters nothing

### Mobile design
After making my site outside of Polytech, Michael pointed out that my site had a few styling errors for mobile devices. So I made a few changes to the styling sheet to make sure my site is compatible with mobile devices etc., this was an easy task since all I had to do is add in the media queries in the styling sheet and overwriting the existing elements.

### Reflection
This week is all about big fixing my site before Showcase. I will have to talk to Fawaz on how the site works during the holidays and before my account gets taken off GitLab. I feel like I have everything ready for the big day and I can't wait to show what I've done to the public.

## Conclusion
Over the past year, I was happy with what I was given. I feel like I should've had more stuff put into this project but most of the time, David was happy with what I have done. There were quite a lot of errors that happened along the way but most of which were fixed by either me or the other project students. This year the project room has become a second home to me for the following reasons, it has given experience of what it's like to be in an office environment with the other classmates as your co-workers. I had so much fun being in this environment and I got to know a lot of people with different backgrounds and mostly I have my very own computer to work with rather than using a classrooms computer and having to deep freeze every time you log off. I will miss this place and the whole Polytech environment, I've been in quite a lot of bad situations over the past two years and I felt like I had been given really good help from the people who have given me it.
