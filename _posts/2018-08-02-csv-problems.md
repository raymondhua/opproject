I have changed my site framework to Django, the reason why I changed it is because after using it in my OOSD assignment, I found it much easier to use than Flask. I borrowed a few bits from my assignment and my Flask site into my Django project. I also changed my database to Microsoft SQL Server. Over the holidays I signed up to Azure for free

I also asked Brett to set up our project repo on Gitlab.
