## David's meeting
I had shown David on what I done, he wanted me set the frequency rate to 0 if the word doesn't exist in the model to prevent errors. He also wanted me to do documentation and the TSNE graph.

## What I've done

### TSNE
I used Jupyter Notebook to test out the TSNE graph. I used Tom's function to try and display the graph properly. I used a test model before I use David's and I managed to get it working.

The graph software that I was using was matplotlib, which I learned in David's ADS class.

I've tried to import the exact code (including the test model) to my Django site, but I had a few problems to get it displaying.

I had to return the Graph using a HTTP response's content type to PNG so it could return the graph, but once I ran it, it didn't display anything so I searched on Google and I found on Stackoverflow that I need to add a function called FigureCanvasEgg and close the graph before I used it and finally, it was displaying. All I had to do now is to import the actual models and get the input from the user and I got it working. 

Below is an image from the 2016 model displaying how close are the words clinton, sanders, donald and trump and how close or far they are from each other.

I wanted to load the TSNE image using Javascript, this is when the image is loaded, it would display an image. I ran through a few issues (such as resizing the canvas) but all was resolved by adding into function.

### Layout changes

#### Design
I changed the layout (again), after a talk with Grayson and Aaron, they felt like orange is a suitable colour for a web page so I had to find a new colour on paletton.com and dark blue was a very good colour. I changed it using the SASS variable. I also wanted to change the font from the generic Sougue UI to something else, I found on Google Fonts a font called Catamaran and import it on top on my sass styling sheet.

I renamed Graph section to Timeline because it sounded more accurate than the former and I changed the tab headers for all pages from Media Analytics to the page that they are on.

#### Article
The page displaying the article had a problem, it was one big string of text and I need to split them into separate paragraphs, I had look at the string text to see what spirits them, it turned out to be a comma after the full-stop so I replaced both characters with a full stop first then have paragraph tags and in the articles page layout I added I put the safe tag for the article text.

The screenshot below is what it looked like before

### Word not exists in model
I added a try/except function in all of my model functions. So now if the word exists in the model it appends into the JSON dictionary if it has an error, it'll fall under the except function and appends into the dictionary saying not found. This was a simple task that I should've done at the start but in the end it still works. So now if the user enters an invalid word in the timeline it would display all 0s for the frequency.

Below is an example of what I implemented for the not match, if the word isn't in the model it returns not match.

### Documentation
I would need to do documentation since I'm handing it over to someone next semester, I would need to do the following

* How to use the site
* What the API and model functions do
* What are API links
* Commenting on code

## What the site looks like now

Results (showing all articles from database):

Timeline page:

Timeline output page:

## Reflection
This week was one of the hardest weeks, mostly because I was scared importing the TSNE image into the project but now, that was a very hard part but one it was fully working, I was very happy with the output. Other than that it was mostly focusing on bug fixing on my project and the help with a few of my project room partners and Adon, I managed to have a fully functioning site with little to no known bugs.
