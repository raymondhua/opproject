## David's meeting
There was no meeting because Monday was Labour Day.

On Tuesday at David's ADS class, he wanted me to load all models when I start the server instead of loading them up every single time I fetch the API (as it would take a long time to load 30 models for 30 years).

## What I've done

### Loading models
I added a new function that would load all models from the code. I created a dictionary where the year would be the key and the value would be the model. Every time the server starts it gets all the years from the models folder and store them in a dictionary. This was a very simple task but at the same time it runs on very high memory and I would need to try and shrink it.

### Site deployment
Michael had many problems with deploying my site but after adding NGNIX and configure the settings file in our project server, we managed to get the site working within the Polytech campus. Now he needs the gateway set-up so that we can host the site publicity.

### Parent evening
On Tuesday, I was invited to the Parent and Whanau where we talk to parents (and family) on what we offer at Polytech, it was a diverse of who came to it (Me, Isabelle, Grayson, Sam), but it was fun but there wasn't much people that we talk to, I don't know if it was a good thing for me because I would mess it up or a bad thing for us as a team because we should've promoted our stall better.
