There was no meeting this week since David was out of town for the first half of the week.

## What I've done

### Implement to site
I've implement Javascript into my site instead of React, otherwise it would mean that I need to rewrite the site from scratch.

I felt like that it was a good idea since I don't want to re-write the site or have two different themes to the site.

I've implemented the compartion of top words between two years, I've used a combination of both JavaScript and Django to produce the output.

## API additions

### Odd one out
I managed to get the API working for the odd one out function.

The algorithm:

1. User enters a few words, separated by a comma
2. The back-end splits it into words by the comma (and remove blank spaces)
3. Run the Gensim function with the array passing in
4. Returns the odd word out and appends it into the JSON dictionary

Below is the output of the API

### POST and GET requests
I've also added to check if it's a POST or GET request, if it's a POST request then it would fetch the data from the form data passing in, it's a GET request it would...
Take note that I would need to reduce code duplication before I finish the project.

### Conclusion
The algorithms I've used to create the API seemed alright. Th
