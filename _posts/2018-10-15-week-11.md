## David's meeting
David was impressed with what I had done. He said for the TSNE function that I would run it on a notebook.

He also wanted a live version of the site running by the end of the week.

## What I've done

## Tooltips

I decided to add tooltips into my project, so whenever the user hovers over the dotted circles, it would display a list of information about the word (e.g. Ranking, word count and frequency). This would be very useful for showcase.

### Website design changes

I've done a few changes to the color scheme, I changed the header, buttons, graph lines to Orange so it doesn't look basic.

### Add extra features

For the main part of of the site, I added an optional section, the user can check for years, sections and authors. I managed to get the years running well. I have been getting problems with the sections because I would need to group them by section otherwise it would return duplicate sections, This would take a bit of time to get it running but once it does I can focus on other optional features.

### Deploying site

Michael now has access to the production server, he has installed the Intel Distribution for Python and along the ways he had many errors on running the site (e.g. requirement problems). I had no hesitation for deploying the site for now.

## Signal
On Wednesday, went to the Signal to talk about their programme, it was a graduate programme for what it feels like to be in the real world (much like Polytech), I felt like that it wasn't for me since what I am doing is I.T. related. But it also gave me a chance on what external opportunities are available.

## Volunteering
On Friday, Me and Matt went to the Community Learning Centre to help out Jackie with her Foundation class, I felt like that it was good fun two hours helping people who have limited technical skills. Jackie also gave us good advice, saying that Polytech is like a retail space (we are the clients and they are the workers giving them good service).

## Reflection

What David wanted me to do for this week seemed alright, it would mean that I would now rely on the Ops team about deploying the site for David and other people to use.

## What the site looks like now...
