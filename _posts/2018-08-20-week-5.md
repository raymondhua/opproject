<!-- ADD COMMENTS TO THE PICTURES-->

From this week, I am writing my blog posts every week summering up on what I have done, this is so that I don't write separate blog posts for everything that I've done by the end of the semester.

## What I've done last week

I looked up on Google for an SQL query on how to find most frequent words what it does is that it separates all of the values in the comma table by space, I knew this would take a long time so I left it overnight and it ran for nearly three hours when I took a look at it the next day.

I also asked Femi to set up a project server to host the site on.

## David's meeting

I showed what I've done to David and he said that there are other ways to perform this task, since it took too long to execute and most of the common words are stop words (e.g. he, the etc.). He recommended me to look up Python NLP sites such as NLP, these are the libraries that I can implement into the website. He also said to look up Tom's NLP repo to see what he's done, since the GitLab repository has been deleted, he sent me a link to his GitHub repository that has the code inside it.

## What I've done

### NLP
I decided to use gensim as the the NLP library,

Originally, when I read on how to use gensim I found it a bit hard to understand but once I figured out how to use it, I ran a few test files how to append data into a model and return all words with the total amount of words in the model.

Once I got it all working, I imported all Chris' CSV files into models and count how many words it is used frequently. I had a few errors along the way but I managed to fix them, the first error was how one of the rows of the file has too much text in one column, the other one is that I would need to lowercase everything because and the last one is that the they have useless special characters (e.g. commas, brackets, speech marks), all of these were fixed by looking up on stackoverflow and I successfully managed to import all CSV files and saved them to a different year.

### API
I made a custom API function that compares two models and returns a JSON file of total word counts for both years, for testing purposes I originally hardcoded all data from the api file and read it, later on once I had all the CSV's imported I used the request post that would read the two years and the word that the user entered, I used Django's JsonResponse for it to work.

I also made another API for the top words mostly used in a model, it would create a dictionary and it would append all the words in the model in to it using the word as the key and the count as the value, it then sorts it by the value descending, then it would create another dictionary by appending the top words until it breaks on a certain number called by the HTML link (e.g. /50 would stop at 50) and returns the dictionary in JSON format.

### Data visualization page
Once that was working, I modified the D3 file so that it can read from the JSON API, I made it call into a function to draw the graph using the API with Javascript.

Then I made a search page that would return a graph using JSON API, I made a search page that would compare the two years and the word that they want to search for. It was only minor tweaks to the both the HTML and JS pages but it was all working in a hour.

## Conclusion
I felt like this was the most effort that I put towards to the project for this semester. Since Tom's site wasn't working I manage to look over his code again and it made much sense of how it works.

The data visualization part was easy since I borrowed most of the code from Web 3.
