## David's meeting
David was happy with what I had done last week. The TSNE preplexity seemed to be out of place but he managed to fix it by making it higher. He wanted me to do a time series for multiple words, originally he wanted to do a time series for multiple words for one graph but I would be too hard especially if they searched for the most and least frequent word in the model so he decided to do a small graph of time series for every word they searched.

## What I've done

### Multiple words
So what I've done with this functionality is the same for the TSNE and the odd one out function, whenever the user enters more than one word seperated by the comma it returns a time series for those words. I've used the bootstrap card functionality for it to work and I had a new javascript function that passes in the API and the card div class and returns a graph within that div. I also added a button for every word on the bottom of the card for it to be opened on a new tab or window, this is so they can show the tooltips of the graph.

The algorithm for this function
1. Converts the string into an array
2. If the array count is 1 then it returns the big time series graph
3. Otherwise it returns small graph of words frequently used overtime

This is the time series home page, with words filled out (separated by comma).

Results for trump, hillary, sanders and obama:

## Reflection
I managed to do the task within 3 hours on the the day of the meeting. I felt like this task was easy because I would need to shrink the graph down and make a few for loops within the template files.
