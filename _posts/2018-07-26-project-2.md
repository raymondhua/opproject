This semester, I'm joined by Fawaz, who will be taking over from Chris' part of the project, originally Adon wanted me to do the project all by myself but I knew that it would be hard since I don't know much about it and I have no interest in it. As the virtual machine for our server was shut down, we will now be using a Mac for testing purposes.

David wanted me to set up a Trello site for us to keep track on what we're doing, we had a Trello board for last semester it but we stopped using it after a few weeks. What I also need to monitor is my Git usage because last semester, I only had a few git commits, but the reason why I ignored git was because I was using a virtual machine and I couldn't be bothered setting up it.
