## David's meeting

David wanted me to make the NLP section of the site, this task would take several weeks to complete and I think that most of the functionality would be completed by the end of the term.

## What I've done

### Template design
I decided that I'll be using Tom's layout of the site. Multiple search queries, Compare two different years.

### React
I started to learn about React because I wanted to add it onto my portfolio, originally it seemed easy, but also at the same time it would mean that I need to re-write the whole site. 

### Find top words

Get the length of the model
Append all the words and their frequent counts into a dictionary
Sort and reverse the dictionary

Below is a snippet of the API of the top words from 1996

## Conclusion
For the next two weeks, I would be not heavily be focusing on my project, This is because David wanted me to focus on other papers (ADS) and this is good time for me to catch up on other work.

I feel like that it would be an easy task but also at the same time hard because I need to run a few methods in the background, This is a great time to learn more about Javascript.
