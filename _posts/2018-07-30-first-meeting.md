Today, I had my first meeting with David and Fawaz. David wanted me to ingest the CSV files into the database of our Mac machine, and also try to get the D3 graph working. I feel like it would be a straight-forward task but also boring at the same time. I also manage to get Trello setup correctly which is shown below.
