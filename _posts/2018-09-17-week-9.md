## David's meeting
This week, he wanted me to complete the rest of the NLP functionality of the site, I showed him on what I've done last week and he seemed okay with it.

## What I've done
This week, I've added a few API functionally into my project and implementing them into my site.

### API functions
I've added the following API functions one by one
* Find similar words
* Find similarity between two words
* Finding the specific word (including the ranking, absolute word count and frequency)

### API Algorithms 

#### Similar words
1. Find words that are similar and returns a dictionary of similar words
2. Append the words and how similar they are into a JSON dictionary

#### Similarity between two words
1. Returns the similarity rate of two words
2. Append both words and how similar they are into a JSON dictionary

#### Specific word
1. Append the total word counts in the model
2. Divides the total word count by the specific word count and times it by 100
3. Append the word, ranking, word count and the frequency into a JSON dictionary

### Site implantation
I've added the odd one out function into my site, when the user enter a string of words the Javascript fetches the odd one out API and displays to the user.

The hardest part (as of 19/09) would be implementing the TSNE image, this would mean going over on what Tom's project to see what he had done and import it into my code.

## Reflection
This week was a very good week for me to focus on my project now that the ADS exam is over, and I felt like that most of this week I had much time to focus on my project.
