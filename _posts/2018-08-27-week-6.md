## David's meeting

I showed David on what I had done and said that it looked okay, he said that I should be counting the frequency of words, meaning finding the total word count for each model and divide it by the word count of it. The task he sets me for this week is to go over Tom's NLP site (again), he said that I would need to import the functionality of the code. He also wants me to talk to the Ops guys about the NLP site, for some reason when David runs a query, it never loads and it's stuck on the loading screen.

## What I've done
I read more about Gensim. I went through Tom's project and his code and I understand the following things
* Find similar words
* Find what words are odd one out.
* Find a specific word and it's rank and frequency

## NLP site
I asked Femi to restore the site, It took him a whole week to get it up and running again, the problem was that Tom made a few changes to the project before he left and it didn't run successfully onto the Gitlab runner.

## Conclusion
Gensim was easy to understand, These functions will be easy import into the project. This week has been a bit easy on me since there wasn't much to do other then learn Gensim.
