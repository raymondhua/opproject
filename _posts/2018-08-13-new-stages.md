I left my computer overnight to see if the CSV importation is successful, it broke around when it reached the 50,000ish. I decided to import another CSV and it also broke around the 50,000ish for having too much characters in one column. I showed David how many article are in the database and he was okay with it. To sum it up, I have just over 100,000 articles in the database for two years.

David wants me to visualize the most frequent words in one column for one year and compare them to another (the same task that he wanted me to do last week), this would be a very hard task for me to do because I would need to search on how to get this working (and I'm testing out on SQL server on what query should I use).

What I also need to do is plan on doing by Thursday is documentation. I need to extend the readme file to include the purpose of the project, how to use the site and set up the Git wiki of our site. I have been using Git more than last semester, I also learned more about merging branches. The next thing I want to utilize is the gitIgnore file, I have added two types of files that I want to ignore, the CSV files and the settings.py file in the Django app.

Below is a screenshot of my git commit history:
